All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.</p>

- Hacktoberfest is a celebration open to everyone in our global community.
- Pull requests can be made in participating GitHub-hosted repositories/projects, classified with the Hacktoberfest topic.
- You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

<h1 align="left">Rules</h1>
<p>To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to participating public repos on GitHub, those that have the Hacktoberfest topic. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the projectâ€™s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 70,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.</br>
